<p>
	I am a final year PhD student at the University of Sydney and CSIRO Space & Astronomy.
	My main research focuses on studying gamma-ray bursts with radio telescopes, while more broadly, I am interested in the study of all astrophysical transients and their use for cosmological studies by any means possible.
	I enjoy experimenting with new methods to do things and taking a data-driven approach to solving problems.

<p>
	I also teach data science, computational science and analytics courses for physics, astronomy and business students.
	I'm always looking for new ways to improve the learning experience for students and welcome any suggestions.
