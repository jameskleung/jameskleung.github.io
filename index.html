<p>
	I am a second year PhD student at the University of Sydney and CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science. My research interests focus on <b>gamma-ray bursts</b>, <b>radio transients</b> and <b>astrophysical transient phenomena</b>, more generally. These often provide a window into studying physics in the most extreme environments of our Universe. I enjoy experimenting with new methods to do things and taking a data-driven approach to solving problems.

<p>
	I also teach data science, computational science and analytics courses for physics, astronomy and business students. I'm always looking for new ways to improve the learning experience for students and welcome any suggestions.
