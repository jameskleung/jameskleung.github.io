I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow jointly appointed by the University of Toronto and Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
  My primary job is to lead a time-domain astronomy research alliance between the two research institutes.
  I am also a co-lead of the PanRadio GRBs collaboration, a member of the ASKAP survey for Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) collaboration, and the VLBA Large Transients collaboration. 
  <!--, and a research affiliate at INAF Istituto di Radioastronomia (INAF/IRA) as well as the the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery (OzGrav).-->

My research focuses on multi-wavelength, observational studies of explosive transients, in particular gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae.
  Through these studies, we try to understand the physical mechanisms driving these cosmic explosions and the environments in which they explode in, ultimately obtaining a better understanding of the many ways a star can die.

As a radio astronomer by training, I have extensive experience with most radio interferometers across the world, including expertise in time-variable wide-field surveys, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), and neutral hydrogen (HI) spectral line studies.
  I also lead programs searching for extreme transients in time-variable wide-field radio surveys and exploring the potential of using astrophysical transients as cosmological probes.
